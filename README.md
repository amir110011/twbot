<h5>Hi Frinds,</h5>
this is a simple Twitter bot that you can put a collection of your messages in a file and separate them with a "*\n" and tweet them just by running the program.

In this program, help has been obtained from the "tweepy" library, which you must install to run this program, as well as create a file with the name "info.py" and put the values that you have taken from the Twitter site in it.
<br>
how to run?<br>
1- install "tweepy" from pip.<br>
2- create "info.py" file in next to the main program files.<br>
3- Get the following values from the developer Twitter site and replace them.<br>
<code>
consumer_key = ''<br>
consumer_secret = ''<br>
access_token = ''<br>
access_token_secret = ''<br>
</code>
<br>
<br>
4- Put your messages in the "mytwitts" file. (Put a * with enter inside each tweet.)<br>
